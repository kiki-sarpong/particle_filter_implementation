# particle_filter_implementation

### This is a project demonstration of a particle filter implementation in python. <br/>
In this project, a simple autonomous "roomba-like" robot is visualized with openCV. The robot moves <br/>
around the cyclic environment and avoids any landmarks in its path. This is just a simple routine for the robot to <br/>
turn a random direction away from the obstacle anytime it detects an obstacle too close to it.
As the robot randomly moves through the environment, a particle filter state estimation algorithm is run to predict the current state of the robot.<br/>
